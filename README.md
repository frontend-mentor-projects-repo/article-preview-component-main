## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learned to used the `z-index`. But tbh I don't really like this challenge -- it's very hard to make the pop-over but it doesn't have much to do with practicing JavaScript (so not sure what is the point of having this challenge as an intro challenge on the JavaScript learning path.)
